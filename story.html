        <h1 class="h1"> The cave seven sleepers</h1>
        <p>The Companions of the Cave were seven young men who lived in the city of Ephesus, Turkey, during the reign of King Decius, a cruel king who was hostile to Christianity.</p>
            <p>The seven young men, named Thamlikha, Maksilimianus, Martiniyanus, Dionisius, Yohanes, Serapion, and Konstantinus, were pious and devout people.<br> They lived in the midst of a corrupt and evil society, but they still held on to their faith and truth.</p>
            <p>One day, King Decius ordered that all Christians in the city of Ephesus be slaughtered. The seven young men refused to give up and decided to flee to a cave outside the city.</p>
            <p>They lived in the cave for 309 years, unnoticed by anyone. During that time, they continued to worship and pray, and maintained their faith.</p>
            <p>One day, the cave was discovered by a shepherd. When the shepherd entered the cave, he found the seven young men still alive and well. They did not realize that they had been sleeping for 309 years.</p>
            <p>When they emerged from the cave, they found that the city of Ephesus had been transformed into a beautiful and prosperous city. They also found that Christianity had flourished and become the dominant religion in the city.</p>
            <p>The seven young men lived for several more years, and they became witnesses to the power of faith and truth. They died in peace, and their story became an inspiration to many people.</p>
            
            <p>The story of the Companions of the Cave is also mentioned in the Qur'an, Surah Al-Kahfi, verses 9-26. This story is an example of the power of faith and patience, and how Allah SWT can preserve and protect His pious servants.</p>

        <p>
          Prophet Musa wanted to learn wisdom from Prophet Khidir. They walked together and Prophet Khidir did several things that Prophet Musa did not understand, such as:</p>

<p> Repairing a broken boat</p>
<p>Killing a young man
<p>Rebuilding a broken wall</p>

<p>Prophet Musa asked about why Prophet Khidir did these things, and Prophet Khidir explained that all of it was done because of the command of Allah SWT.</p>

<p>Prophet Khidir taught Prophet Musa about the importance of patience and not asking about things he did not know. Prophet Musa apologized and returned to the Children of Israel to continue his duties as a prophet.</p>
